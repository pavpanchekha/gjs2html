<p>General instructions for problem sets:
A problem set for this class generally asks you to do some
programming.  We usually give you a program to read and extend.  You
should turn in your extensions, in the form of clearly annotated code
and executions that demonstrate its effectiveness.  We may also ask
for short essays explaining an idea.  Your answers to these questions
must be clear and concise: good logic expressed in good English is
required.  Thank you.

<h1>Our Goal</h1>
<p>Our goal in this class is to learn what we can about making programs
flexible, so that they can be adapted to uses that we did not
anticipate when we designed them.  For example, there are elementary
mechanisms that we can use to change the behavior of a procedure
without modifying the procedure text.  One such mechanism that we will
investigate in this first set of exercises is called &quot;advice&quot;.  Advice
procedures are easy to use, and they are often used in debugging, but
they are rarely used in making permanent modifications to a program.
We will first examine how such procedures work, and how they can be
used.  We will then look into the potentialities and limitations of
this kind of program modification.
</p>
<h1>Advice Procedures</h1>
<p>The basic idea of &quot;advice&quot; is that it is possible to modify the
behavior of a procedure by attaching modifications, composing those
modifications with the advised procedure.  
</p>
<p>For example, in MIT/GNU Scheme pi is not defined, but we can fix that
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(define pi (* 4 (atan 1 1)))

pi
;Value: 3.141592653589793</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, this is an inexact number so our sine routine produces
an inexact answer:
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(sin pi)
;Value: 1.2246467991473532e-16</pre>
<p>Suppose we wanted to change the sine routine so that it knew about the
special symbol symbolic-pi.  We could redefine the sine routine as
follows:
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(define symbolic-pi 'symbolic-pi)

(define sin
  (let ((oldsine sin))
    (named-lambda (sin x) 
      (cond ((eq? x symbolic-pi) 0)
            (else (oldsine x))))))

(sin symbolic-pi)
;Value: 0

(sin pi)
;Value: 1.2246467991473532e-16</pre>
<p>So, we have advised the sin procedure to have a special value when it
is passed the symbolic-pi (rather than the numerical pi).  Of course,
we could do lots of stuff here, such as conditionally bypass oldsine
or modify its output based on some condition.
</p>
<aside class="note"> named-lambda is just like lambda, except that the procedure
       name is provided as the first element of the bound-variable
       list.  This allows the name to be attached to the procedure so
       the debugger can report it.  The resulting procedure does not
       expect an argument in that slot: The procedure specified by
        (named-lambda (foo x y) ...) has the same behavior as
        (lambda (x y) ...).  Both take two arguments.
</aside>
<h1>Formalizing advice</h1>
<p>We could formalize this kind of advice with a macro that takes a
symbol and a wrapper procedure and builds the wrapped procedure
definition.  Note: subtlety of renaming wrapper to ewrapper...why?
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(define-syntax advise-unary
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((advise-unary p wrapper)
     (define p
       (let ((saved-p p) (ewrapper wrapper))
         (named-lambda (p x)
           (ewrapper 'p saved-p x)))))))

(advise-unary sin
              (lambda (name oldf x)
                (cond ((eq? x symbolic-pi) 0)
                      ((number? x) (oldf x))
                      (else
                       (error &quot;Argument not number&quot; name)))))</pre>
<p>And if we don't like the modified sin routine, we can always recover
the original:
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(define sin (access sin system-global-environment))</pre>
<p>However, it would be nicer to have the advisor remember the old
version so it can be unadvised.  This is easy, using &quot;sticky notes&quot;
implemented in the library &quot;eq-properties.scm&quot;.  The procedures
eq-put! and eq-get are used to attach and access extra information 
to any piece of data.  This uses an external hash table.
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(define-syntax advise-unary
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((advise-unary p wrapper)
     (define p
       (let ((saved-p p) (ewrapper wrapper))
         (let ((new-p 
                (named-lambda (p x)
                  (ewrapper 'p saved-p x))))
           (eq-put! new-p 'old-version saved-p)
           new-p))))))

(define-syntax remove-advice
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((remove-advice p)
     (begin (set! p (eq-get p 'old-version)) 'done))))</pre>
<p>So we can remove the advice from sin by:
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(remove-advice sin)</pre>
<section class="pset"><h1>Problem 1.1: Warmup</h1>
<p>a. The program above is very flaky.  For example, if you remove advice
   from an unadvised procedure it will set the procedure to #f, which
   is not what you wanted: probably you should warn the user and do
   nothing.  Also, you will get nonsense if you try to advise a binary
   procedure with advise-unary.  It should check that it is being
   given a sensible procedure.  In section 12.2 of the MIT/GNU Scheme
   reference manual you can learn how to get the arity of a procedure.
</p>
<p>b. The code above works for unary procedures like sin or sqrt.
   However there are binary procedures and n-ary procedures that we
   would like to advise.  Write analogous macros to advise binary and
   n-ary procedures.  Demonstrate that your macros work, by advising
   cons and +.  
</p>
<aside class="note"> In Scheme we specify a procedure that takes many arguments with
       a symbol in the position of the bound-variable list, as in
       (lambda xs ...).  The symbol (here xs) is bound to the list of
       arguments.  The define syntax for something like addition is
       (define (+ . xs) ...).  For a fuller description of the syntax
       of definition see Sections 2.1 and 2.4 of the MIT/GNU Scheme
       Reference Manual.
</aside>
</section>
<h1>Advice for Debugging</h1>
<p>One common application of advice is in debugging of programs.  For
example, it is possible to trace a procedure, logging each entry and
exit.  One example wrappper procedure is:
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(define (full-trace-wrapper procname proc args)
  (newline)
  (display &quot;;Entering &quot;) (write procname)
  (display &quot; with &quot;) (write args)
  (let ((val (apply proc args)))
    (newline)
    (display &quot;;Leaving &quot;) (write procname)
    (display &quot; Value=&quot;) (write val)
    val))</pre>
<p>To trace the sine procedure we can then write
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(advise-nary sin full-trace-wrapper)</pre>
<section class="pset"><h1>Problem 1.2: Tracing</h1>
<p>Sometimes we do not want a complete trace like the one above.  For
example, we may want to look at only the entries to a procedure, or
only the exits from the procedure.  Of course, this just requires
simpler versions of the full-trace-wrapper.  
</p>
<p>a. One problem with the full-trace-wrapper is that it breaks tail
   recursion.  Is this essential?  If so, explain why.  If not, show
   how to make a wrapper that does not break tail recursion.
</p>
<p>b. Sometimes we have an iterative procedure that will be entered many
   times, but will be exited only once, such as the fact-iter
   procedure:
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(define (fact-iter product counter max-count)
  (if (&gt; counter max-count)
      product
      (fact-iter (* counter product) (+ counter 1) max-count)))

(define (fact n) (fact-iter 1 1 n))</pre>
<p>   It would be nice to make a special tracing wrapper that could be
   applied to fact-iter that shows the first entry to fact-iter and
   the exit, but not the intermediate entries.  Write such a wrapper.  
   Try to make it so that it does not break the tail-recursion of 
   fact-iter where it calls itself.
   Hint: It can help to use a fluid variable. (See section 2.3 of the 	
   MIT/GNU Scheme Reference Manual.)
</p>
</section>
<h1>Advice for Authorization</h1>
<p>Another potential use for procedural advice is authorization of a user
or a process to execute a particular operation.  For example, suppose
we wanted to restrict the use of the sine function to a select set of
wizards.  (After all, you never know what kind of trouble a newbie
could get into computing the sines of angles!)  Using advice we could
modify the sin procedure to check that the process is authorized to
compute the sine.  We arrange that there is information that the
authorization wrapper has access to that may contain a key, which if
matched by the authorization wrapper allows the sin procedure to
continue.  A very simple and insecure authorization wrapper is:
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(define (authorization-wrapper procname proc args)
   (cond ((memq (eq-get proc 'authorization-key)
                (or (eq-get user-id 'authorizations)
                    '()))
          (apply proc args))
         (else
          (error &quot;Unauthorized access&quot; user-id procname))))</pre>
<p>For each procedure that needs authorization we wrap it and provide an
authorization key.
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(advise-nary sin authorization-wrapper)
(eq-put! sin 'authorization-key 'ok-to-sin)</pre>
<p>Each user is provided with a set of authorizations.  For example,
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(eq-put! gjs 'authorizations
         `(ok-to-sin ok-to-cos ok-to-atan ok-to-read-files))</pre>
<section class="pset"><h1>Problem 1.3: Authorization</h1>
<p>Of course, this is a minimal authorization wrapper.  A real one would
involve cryptographic mechanisms, for example.  MIT/GNU Scheme
provides some simple support for such mechanisms.  For example,
(md5-string &quot;foo&quot;) will give a hash string.  
</p>
<p>a. Construct a better version of the authorization wrapper.  
</p>
<p>b. Suppose we wanted to put up a version of MIT/GNU Scheme as a
   server, Which procedures would we want to require authorization
   for?  (Obvious ones are ones that manipulate the file system.  Are
   there others?  Why?  This is an opportunity to scan the reference
   manual.) 
</p>
</section>
<h1>Advice for Memoization</h1>
<p>Another nice idea is memoization: using memory to trade space for
time.  Dynamic programming is just an application of memoization.  
For example, consider the elementary doubly-recursive procedure for
computing Fibonacci numbers:
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(define (fib n)
  (if (&lt; n 2)
      n
      (+ (fib (- n 2))
         (fib (- n 1)))))</pre>
<p>This produces an exponential process.  For example, the time to
compute (fib 30) is about 1.5 seconds (1500 milliseconds) on my
laptop.
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(show-time
 (lambda ()
   (fib 30)))
;process time: 1510 (1500 RUN + 10 GC); real time: 1512
;Value: 832040</pre>
<p>And the time to compute (fib 31) is about 1.6 times as long.  (Each
increment in the argument multiplies the time by the golden ratio.)
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(show-time
 (lambda ()
   (fib 31)))
;process time: 2430 (2410 RUN + 20 GC); real time: 2423
;Value: 1346269</pre>
<p>So we should never be able to compute (fib 100) by this method.
</p>
<p>However, if we remember the values of (fib 99) and (fib 98) the
computation of (fib 100) takes only one operation.  So let's make a
wrapper that remembers the values of old arguments and old values:
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(define (memo-wrapper procname proc x)
  (let ((seen (assv x (eq-get proc 'old-values))))
    (if seen
        (cdr seen)
        (let ((v (proc x)))
          (eq-put! proc 
                   'old-values
                   (cons (cons x v)
                         (eq-get proc 'old-values)))
          v))))</pre>
<p>Initialize the memory and add the wrapper.  Note the order of these 
two operations is critical.  (Think about why this is true.)
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(eq-put! fib 'old-values '())
(advise-unary fib memo-wrapper)</pre>
<p>What a difference this makes!:
</p>
<pre data-lang="scheme">(show-time
 (lambda ()
   (fib 30)))
;process time: 0 (0 RUN + 0 GC); real time: 0
;Value: 832040

(show-time
 (lambda ()
   (fib 100)))
;process time: 0 (0 RUN + 0 GC); real time: 0
;Value: 354224848179261915075</pre>
<section class="pset"><h1>Problem 1.4: Memoization</h1>
<p>a. The wrapper we show remembers all previous computations of the
   memoized function.  But Fibonacci needs only remember the last two
   values computed.  Make a memoizer that keeps only a two last
   values.  Demonstrate that this works for Fibonacci.
</p>
<p>b. What about functions with multiple arguments?  Make a memoizer that
   works for functions of multiple integer arguments.
</p>
</section>
<h1>Moral of this story</h1>
<p>There is a lot more to this story than we can handle in one problem
set.  Advice allows us to write the essential idea of a computation
simply (such as the doubly-recursive Fibonacci procedure), while
allowing us to impose modifications that transform its behavior,
without changing the essential simplicity of the code.  These
modifications are called cross-cutting concerns.  Indeed, one
elaboration of the story of procedural advice is the &quot;paradigm&quot; called
Aspect-oriented Programming.  
(See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming</a>)
</p>
<p>But be careful, this is not a panacea!  It is just one technique.
There are no magic bullets, just lots of good tools that we should use
when appropriate.
